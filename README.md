Unique Integers from File

Welcome to the "Unique Integers from File" project! This project is a JavaScript application that reads a file and extracts unique integers from it.

Instructions
To get started with this project, follow these simple steps:

Place your input file in the project directory. The input file should contain a list of integers, each on a separate line.
Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org).
Running the Project
To run the project, follow these steps:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory using the cd command. For example, if the project directory is named "uniqueInt_assignment-point", you can navigate to it by running:
Copy
Insert
cd uniqueInt_assignment-point

Once you are in the project directory, run the following command to execute the project:
Copy
Insert
node Main.js
This command will start the execution of the project and read the input file, extracting the unique integers from it.

Output
The project will generate an output file in the "Myoutput" directory (if it doesn't already exist) with the same name as the input file, but with the extension ".output.txt". This file will contain the unique integers extracted from the input file, each on a separate line.

Conclusion
This project provides a simple example of how to read a file and extract unique integers using JavaScript. It demonstrates the use of file handling and array manipulation techniques in JavaScript. Feel free to modify and extend the project to suit your needs.
